This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Bug reproduction

This repo is a minimal reproduction of an issue with react-jss dynamic values and Next.js

If you run

```
$ npm run build
$ npm run export
$ serve out
```

and visit localhost:5000, you will see the intended behavior: two boxes with CSS generated by `react-jss`, one red and one blue. The red one can toggle its background.

However, if you run

```
$ npm run dev
```

and visit localhost:3000, you will see one red box and one unstyled box. The red one should toggle between blue and red, but it does not.

In the console, you will see the following error:

```
Warning: Prop `className` did not match. Server: "root-0-2-3 root-d0-0-2-5" Client: "root-0-2-3 root-d1-0-2-6"
    at div
    at MyDynamicComponent (webpack-internal:///./components/MyDynamicComponent.js:43:27)
    ...
```
